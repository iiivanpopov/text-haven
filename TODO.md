# Feature Tracking

## TODO

### Frontend

- Connect frontend to backend
- Optimize frontend components
- Dockerize

### Backend

- Cover backend with tests(at least caching)(I finally understood why I need it)
- Improve scalability

## WIP (Work in Progress)

- Integrate Redux Toolkit for state management

---

**Note:**

- "UI only" means the page is static and not yet connected to backend functionality.
